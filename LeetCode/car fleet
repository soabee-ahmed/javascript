    - fleet is when cars gets lined up like ..c2c1
    - if the cars intersect anywhere reaching the target they will form a fleet
    - faster car will slow down to match the speed of slower car
Approach
    - How to know if cars intersect?
    - Use the time to reach the target
    - c1 reaches target at (12-10)/2 = 1
    - c2 reaches target at (12-8)/4 = 1
    - if t2<=t1 that means c2 will reach before c1
    - that means c2 will c1 first (as it is behind c1)
    - and reduce its speed to that of c2

    - start with the cars with positions closer to target (by sorting the cars by their positions)
    - they will decide the speed of the fleet (or just the fact that one fleet is formed)
    - use a stack to form the order of slower to faster cars
