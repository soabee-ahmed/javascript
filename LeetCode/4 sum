Algorithm / Intuition
Optimal Approach: 
In this approach, we intend to get rid of two things i.e. the HashSet we were using for the look-up operation and the set data structure used to store the unique quadruplets.

Again the solution to this will be similar to the optimal approach of the  3-sum problem. In that approach, we had fixed a pointer i, and the rest 2 pointers were moving. Similarly, here, as we are dealing with quads instead of triplets we will fix 2 pointers i.e. i and j and the rest of the 2 pointers will be moving.

Now, we need to first understand what the HashSet and the set were doing to make our algorithm work without them. So, the set data structure was basically storing the unique quadruplets in sorted order and the HashSet was used to search for the fourth element.

To get the quadruplets in sorted order, we will sort the entire array in the first step and to get the unique quads, we will simply skip the duplicate numbers while moving the pointers.

How to skip duplicate numbers:
As the entire array is sorted, the duplicate numbers will be in consecutive places. So, while moving a pointer, we will check the current element and the adjacent element. Until they become different, we will move the pointer by 1 place. We will follow this process for all 4 pointers. Thus, we can easily skip the duplicate elements while moving the pointers.

Now, we can also remove the HashSet as we have two moving pointers i.e. k and l that will find the appropriate value of nums[k] and nums[l]. So, we do not need the HashSet anymore.

The process will look like the following:


Among the 4 pointers, 2 will be fixed and 2 will be moving. In each iteration, we will check if the sum i.e. nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]+nums[l] is equal to the target. 

If the sum is greater, then we need lesser elements and so we will decrease the value of l. 
If the sum is lesser than the target, we need a bigger value and so we will increase the value of k. 
If the sum is equal to the target, we will simply insert the quad i.e. nums[i], nums[j], nums[k], and nums[l] into our answer and move the pointers k and l skipping the duplicate elements.
Approach:

The steps are as follows:

First, we will sort the entire array.
We will use a loop(say i) that will run from 0 to n-1. This i will represent one of the fixed pointers. In each iteration, this value will be fixed for all different values of the rest of the 3 pointers. Inside the loop, we will first check if the current and the previous element is the same and if it is we will do nothing and continue to the next value of i.
After checking inside the loop, we will introduce another fixed pointer j(runs from i+1 to n-1) using another loop. Inside this second loop, we will again check for duplicate elements and only perform any further operation if the elements are different.
Inside the second loop, there will be 2 moving pointers i.e. k(starts from j+1) and l(starts from the last index). The pointer k will move forward and the pointer l will move backward until they cross each other while the value of i and j will be fixed.
Now we will check the sum i.e. nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]+nums[l].
If the sum is greater, then we need lesser elements and so we will decrease the value of l.
If the sum is lesser than the target, we need a bigger value and so we will increase the value of k. 
If the sum is equal to the target, we will simply insert the quad i.e. nums[i], nums[j], nums[k], and nums[l] into our answer and move the pointers k and l skipping the duplicate elements(i.e. by checking the adjacent elements while moving the pointers).
Finally, we will have a list of unique quadruplets.


Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N3), where N = size of the array.
Reason: Each of the pointers i and j, is running for approximately N times. And both the pointers k and l combined can run for approximately N times including the operation of skipping duplicates. So the total time complexity will be O(N3). 

Space Complexity: O(no. of quadruplets), This space is only used to store the answer. We are not using any extra space to solve this problem. So, from that perspective, space complexity can be written as O(1).
